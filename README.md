# Pandas-challenge

This was a very frustrating project for me. I estimate that I spent about 25 hours this week working on it, mostly hitting dead ends.

When I finally asked for help (the night before it was due), I realized that I was treating a groupby object like a dataframe, and also that I was trying to do too many computations at once and needed to break it down into smaller pieces.

If I had asked for help earlier, I would have been able to complete the project. My final hurdle was figuring out how to extract the number of students who scored 70+ on the math and reading tests at each school. Once I figured that out, I would have been able to divide it by the number of students at each school and multiply by 100 to get the % and finished out the summary by school table.

The only reason I wasn't able to complete the last 3 tables was because I wasn't able to finish the % passing calculation and the summary by school table.

Based on the sample data tables, some conclusions to draw are that scores are generally consistent across grades within each school, there seems to be an inverse correlation between school spending and test scores, and that schools with populations under 2,000 and Charter schools tend to have higher test scores.
